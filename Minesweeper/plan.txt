-first lets get familiar with media queries

-development should begin slowly. I want to first focus on just getting the basic html/css structure out, and building
the queries so that it looks good on mobile. leave out the asthetic details

-note that everything should be scalable, so %'s are prefered to actual pixel units

-flex layout can be used to keep the grid of buttons orderly (grid layout may be prefered then)

Code Design:
-use boolean to see if this is the first button/card being hit
-i still prefer to use onclick to get the events (pavol prefers to manually add in the event listener with addEventLister, which 
might better)
-have a 2D grid object, where we hold all button objects (it will be booleans)
-same object can also have value for the number (so its a struct)
-clicking empty square revels all adjacent empty squares (seems best to be recursive). use loop iteration to see whats adjacent 
(-1, 0, -1)



To Research:
-can a button know if its been a long press? cause essentially all the cards are buttons
-how will buttons in 2D grid object know their neighbours. how do it fast? 
-how to recognize a long tap

Notes:
-landscape: max width of 800px
-portrait: full width, whatever height
